# free_energy_barriers
This project gives numerical results for the non-linear problem considered in [1]. It is also the code used to explore the existence of a free energy barrier in Bayesian logistic regression. See the Notebook NumpyrhoMALA.ipynb. Theoretical results are currently being explored. This is joint work with Prof. Sven Wang.
